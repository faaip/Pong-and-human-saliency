Content of repository:
- Data
  - data of intermediate steps for agent and human experiment (model_agent, movies)
  - eye-tracking data of humans (tobi)
  - saliency data of agent (saliency_agent)
- Scripts
  - all scripts used for performing agent experiment, (pre-)processing data from agent and eye-tracking data, and analysis of dataset
  - (folder: exp_func) scripts provided by Greydanus et al. (https://github.com/greydanus/visualize_atari/)
