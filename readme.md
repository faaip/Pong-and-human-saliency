### Cognitive Science 3 project - Frederik Tollund Juutilainen, Maud Ottenheijm and Maxim van Oldenbeek

This repository contains all code used to perform and analyze the eye-tracking/RL study (see title above) performed as part of the course Cognitive Science 3,  at the University of Copenhagen. Code from previous research has been used and adapted to perform this study, and is referenced where nescessary. All other code is written by the authors named above.
